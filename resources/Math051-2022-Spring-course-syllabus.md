   The text is available from [the Tufts University
   bookstore](https://tufts.bncollege.com/shop/tufts/page/find-textbooks).

   *Scans of parts of the textbook will be made available on the course [canvas site].*

## Course structure and schedule

   All students are enrolled in the course lectures, which meet on
   Mondays and Wednesdays 1:30--2:20 PM and are given by Professor
   McNinch.

   Each student is enrolled in a *practicum* or *recitation* that
   meets once each week on either Thursday or Friday.
 

## Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}

Your grade in the course is determined by
from **homework**, **recitation work**, and **exams**.

- **Homework**

  There will be *weekly problem sets*. Problem sets will be posted on
  the course [canvas site]. Your written response be collected via
  [gradescope]. Your work will be marked, and at the end of the
  semester your total score will be determined as the average of your
  homework scores.

  Late problem sets can be submitted for an additional 2 days
  following the posted due date, subject to a 10% point reduction. Of
  course, if there are extenuating circumstances, *let us know*.

  Please see the `Course Resources` documents for more information on
  [gradescope].

- **Practicum/Recitation**

  Each student of the course is enrolled in a weekly
  practicum/recitation. You should expect to have some assessment in
  this setting each week -- either in the form of a *quiz* or a
  *worksheet*. The recitation worksheets are distinct from the
  *problem sets*.
  
  Again, at the end of the semester, your total recitation score is
  computed as the average of your recitation scores.
  
- **Exams**

  There will be two midterm exam and one final exam. 
  
  - **Midterm 1** -- **Mon 2022-02-14 @ 12:00-01:20 PM**.
	
  - **Midterm 2** -- **Mon 2022-04-04  @ 12:00-01:20 PM**.
  
  - the **Final Exam** -- **Mon 2022-05-09  @ 08:30-10:30 AM**.


- **Grading Summary**

  Write $L$ and $H$ for the lower respectively higher of your two midterm scores.
  Your score in the class is determined by the formula:
  
  $$\left(0.25\times \operatorname{Final}\right) + 
    \left(0.10 \times L\right) + 
	\left(0.20 \times H \right) + 
	\left(0.25 \times \operatorname{Recitation} \right) + 
	\left(0.20 \times \operatorname{Homework}\right)$$
	
  Your *letter grade* is then determined from this score using the scheme
  described here:
  [https://math.tufts.edu/resources/grading-schemes](https://math.tufts.edu/resources/grading-schemes).
