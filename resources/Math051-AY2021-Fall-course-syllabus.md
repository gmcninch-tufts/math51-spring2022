   Course, 3rd ed.*, Saunders (1992). (Reprint works fine.)
   
   The text is available from [the Tufts University
   bookstore](https://tufts.bncollege.com/shop/tufts/page/find-textbooks).

## Course schedule

For each section, the course meets twice a week: once in-person, and
once on [zoom].  We intend that the [zoom] meetings will be a lecture
on the week's material; the in-person lectures and the recitation will
then be spent in further discussion and investigation of those topics.

Here is the weekly schedule of lectures:

  |         | location            |  01-McNinch |  02-McNinch |  03-Nitecki |  04-Nitecki |
  |-----    |:------------------- |:----------- |:----------- |:----------- |:----------- |
  | **Mon** | BP2 (all sections)  | 09:00-10:15 |             | 10:30-11:45 |             |

## Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}

You can earn up to 400 points in the course, with contributions
from **homework**, **recitation work**, and **exams**.

- **Homework**

  There will be *weekly problem sets*. Written work will be collected
  via [gradescope]. Your work will be marked and your total score will
  earn you up to 80 points.

  Ordinarily, late problem sets and exams will be accepted but with a
  10% point reduction for each day that an assignment is late. Of
  course, if there are extenuating circumstances, *let us know*.

  Problem sets and the midterm & final reports will be collected on
  [gradescope]. See the `Course Resources` documents for more
  information on [gradescope].

- **Recitations**

  Each student of the course is enrolled in a weekly recitation. You
  should expect to have some assessment in recitation each week --
  either a *quiz* or a *worksheet*. The recitation worksheets are
  distinct from the *problem sets*.
  
  Your cumulative assessment in recitation will earn you up to 120
  points in the course.
  
  A recitation is not associated with a particular lecture section;
  students from all four sections can be in any one of the
  recitations.
  
- **Exams**

  There will be one midterm exam and one final exam. Each will earn
  you up to 100 points in the course.
  
  - The **midterm exam** is scheduled for **Wednesday October 20 at 6:00-7:20 PM**
    in Pearson Lab 104.
	
  - The **final exam** is scheduled for **Friday December 17 at 8:30-10:30 AM**
    (location *TBA*).
