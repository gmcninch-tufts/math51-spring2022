Gradescope
============

During the course, students will submit solutions to *problem sets*. 

These submissions will be made via [gradescope]; your work will be
read/marked by course instructor/course TA, and will be returned, again
via [gradescope].


Make sure that when you log in to [gradescope], you use the *school
credentials* option. You should select *Tufts University*, and you'll
then be able to login with your **UTLN**. The roster on [gradescope]
has already been populated using the roster on [canvas].

Note that *written* submissions to [gradescope] must be made in the
form of `PDF` files. If you plan to submit handwritten work, it will
need to be scanned.  *Make sure to get a high-quality scan*. More
information about student submissions to gradescope is [available
here](https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission). In
particular, you can find information/advice about getting a good scan
of handwritten work
