Gradescope
============

During the course, students will submit solutions to *problem sets*. 

These submissions will be made via [gradescope]; your work will be
read/marked by course instructor/course TA, and will be returned, again
via [gradescope].


Make sure that when you log in to [gradescope], you use the *school
credentials* option. You should select *Tufts University*, and you'll
then be able to login with your **UTLN**. The roster on [gradescope]
has already been populated using the roster on [canvas].

Note that *written* submissions to [gradescope] must be made in the
form of `PDF` files. If you plan to submit handwritten work, it will
need to be scanned.  *Make sure to get a high-quality scan*. More
information about student submissions to gradescope is [available
here](https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission). In
particular, you can find information/advice about getting a [good scan
of handwritten work
here](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf).

Zoom
=====

The *Friday* lectures in all course sections will be *virtual*,
on [Zoom].

Probably you are all pretty used to using [Zoom] by now, so 
going to give a ton of details here.

You'll find links for the sessions on the course `canvas` site.

We do have two requests:

- Please make sure that your screen-name in [Zoom] is the name that you'd
  like to be called, while at the same time making it clear that you
  are actually a student of the class!
  
- We would like to ask you to have your camera on when we meet on Zoom
  if possible.  and you to your peers if we can
  see each otherâ€™s faces. I understand that for some of you, there are
  reasons you might not be able to have your camera on. If not, there
  is no requirement to explain it to me, but in that case it will be
  helpful if you can use a picture of yourself as your ``profile
  picture`` to represent you in ``zoom``.
