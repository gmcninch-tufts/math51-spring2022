# Recall the material discussed in lectures

  Namely, *separation of variables* and *first order linear ODEs*
  
  I had several questions after the lecture on Monday about the
  "constant solutions" arising in separation of variables.
  
  (Namely, the solutions $x(t) = r$ for the ODE $x' = f(x)g(t)$ where
  $r$ is a solution to $f(x) = 0$.)

# Applications/examples

  I suggest that we use ยง1.4 in the text as a source of
  applications/examples. In particular, we can present the following
  models given by first-order linear equations.
  
  - Newton's Law of Cooling (p. 30-31), and
  - the Kirchoff's Law application on (p. 32-33)

# Integrating factors

  Explain the "alternative approach" to solving first-order linear
  ODEs described on [@gutermanNitecki, sec. 1.3, p. 28]
