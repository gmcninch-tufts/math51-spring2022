You may not use *calculators*, *books* or *notes* during the exam. All
electronic devices (including your phones) must be *silenced* and *put
away* for the duration of the exam.

After finishing your exam, you will submit this exam booklet. We will
scan your submission and upload it to *Gradescope* for marking (you do
*not* need to take/upload images of your exam with a phone). You
should write your name at the top of each page, as indicated
(*especially* if you remove the staples from your exam booklet).

For the partial credit problems, always *show your work*. Try to fit
this work in the *available space* if possible.  There is a blank page
at the back of your exam for use as scratch paper. If you need more
space for a solution, please write clearly *in the indicated space*
that your solution continues later.
