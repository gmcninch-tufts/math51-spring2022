- [X] One minor edit in the instructions: par. 3 line 3: uploaded it ->
      upload it
      
- [X] Prob (I)1: “in-homogeneous”-> non-homogeneous

- [X] prob.(I) 6: I think writing the selections the way you did is
  kind of gotcha.  Either write them in the form e^{2t} v + te^{2t} w
  or as a single column (or e{2t} times a single column).

- [X] Prob (I)7: “matrix with constant coefficients a_{ij}” is, I think,
  best left out.

- [X] Prob (I) 8: I think writing the fourth option in a different way
  from the other three is awkward.

- [ ] Prob (II) 5a: kind of gotcha—I kept looking at my calculation
  and wondering why I was getting A=0 in the partial fractions, until
  I realized that it simplifies.  Maybe change the numerator to 3s^2+s+1?

- [ ] Overall, the exam seems way too long.  I worked out the problems
  (checking that the statements about eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  were true) and it took me a little over an hour, with a (needed)
  break in the middle.

- [ ] I would suggest eliminating (!)3,4,7,8 (these are very involved,
  in a sense, for multiple choice problems) and (II)4.

- [ ] I think (II)2 in its present form will be a headache to grade
  (so many ways they might write the eigenvector).

- [ ] I suggest making two problems out of this idea, one a “find the
  eigenvector” problem, the other more like some of your multiple
  choice problems: give them the (complex) eigenvectors and ask them
  to write the general solution as well as the solution to a specific
  IC problem. Maybe some part of this could become a multiple choice
  problem.
