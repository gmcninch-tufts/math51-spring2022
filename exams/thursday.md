Anca,

The following students

 - Shanni Zhou
 - Davonte Hudson
 - Alexa Watson
 
should take the exam at 1:30, and I believe

 - Anna DeCotis

should show up at 2:15.

Alexa has an extended time accomodation and should get 120 minutes for
the exam. The others should get 80.

There may well be others who didn't confirm (there were a handful of
crisis cases, and I don't in all cases know the outcome. So they may
show up... just give them the exam and I can sort things out later).

Thanks again!!

Best,
george
