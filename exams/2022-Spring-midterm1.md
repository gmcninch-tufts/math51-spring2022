There are **6 problems** on the exam.

You may not use *calculators*, *books* or *notes* during the exam. All
electronic devices (including your phones) must be *silenced* and *put
away* for the duration of the exam.

After finishing your exam, you will submit this exam booklet. We will
scan your submission and upload it to *Gradescope* for marking (you
do *not* need to take images of your exam). You should write your name
at the top of each page, as indicated (*especially* if you remove the
staples from your exam booklet).


For the partial credit problems, always *show your work*. Try to fit
this work in the *available space* if possible.  There is a blank page
at the back of your exam for use as scratch paper. If you need more
space for a solution, please write clearly *in the indicated space*
that your solution continues later.

#. 20 points) Short-answer questions.  Each question is worth two points.  
   No work needs to be shown, as only the answer will be graded. Write
   your answers in the indicated boxes.


   #. Consider the differential equation $$(t-3)^2 x'' + \frac{1}{t-2}
      x' + 2x = 0.$$

      o.d.e. is normal.

   #. True or False.  Let $h_1, h_2, h_3$ be solutions of a normal
      third-order linear differential equation on $(-\infty,\infty)$.
      If the Wronskian satisfies $W[h_1, h_2, h_3](t_0) = 0$ at one
      real number $t_0$ then it satisfies $W[h_1, h_2,
      h_3](t) = 0$ for *every* real number $t$.

   #. True or False.  Let $h_1, h_2, h_3$ be solutions of a
      normal, **fourth**-order linear differentiable equation on
      $(-\infty,\infty)$.  If the Wronskian satisfies $W[h_1, h_2,
      h_3](0) = 1$, then the general solution is given by
	  $$x(t) = c_1 h_1(t) + c_2h_2(t) + c_3h_3(t).$$

      Wronskian satisfies $W[h_1, h_2, h_3](1) \ne 0$.  Which of the
      following statements is true?  \smallskip \begin{enumerate}
      \item[I.]  $h_1(t), h_2(t), h_3(t)$ generate the general
