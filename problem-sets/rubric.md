Read first: the following are some guidelines for answering
homework in the course:

1. A correct answer does not guarantee credit. 

   Your goal in answering a problem should be to convince the grader
   of comprehension. Given that no assignments will be proctored and
   that there are many online tools available, a correct answer
   without work shown does little to demonstrate understanding and may
   receive little to no credit. In short: Show your work!

2. Use your words! 

   Many problems in this course can be answered purely in math
   terms. While that may at times be sufficient, it is often helpful
   to use words between steps and to use words to justify choices made
   in solving a problem. (In the future we will post solutions which
   may serve as examples in this regard.)

3. Neatness of work will be included in homework grades. 

   It is important that the graders can clearly read the work. If work
   cannot be read or easily followed, then the grader may not be
   convinced of complete understanding of the material and points may
   be lost.
