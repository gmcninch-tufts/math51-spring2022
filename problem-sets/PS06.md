These problems relate to material of [@gutermanNitecki § 2.7 and 2.8]. 

# Reminders

- *no practicums* this week (Thursday 2022-02-24, Friday 2022-02-25).

# Reading for the Week of 2022-02-22

- \S 2.7: Non-homogeneous equations: undetermined coefficients
- \S 2.8: Non-homogeneous equations: variation of parameters

# Problems 

#. Find the constant-coefficient linear operator $A(D)$ of smallest order for which
   $$A(D)[te^{-t}\cos(2t) + 2e^{3t}] = 0.$$

#. Make a *simplified guess*  for a particular solution to the ODE
   $$(D−1)^2(D^2+1)x=te^{3t}+e^t−\sin(t).$$

   Note: In this problem,  you *aren't asked to solve for the coefficients*.


#. Find the *general solution* to the ODE $$(D^3 - D^2 - 2D)x = 1 + e^{2t}.$$

#. Solve the initial value problem:
   $$(D^2 - 9)x = 9 + 12e^{-3t}; \quad x(0) = x'(0) = 0.$$

#. Find the general solution to 

   $$x'' - 2x' + x = e^t \ln(t), \quad t>0.$$

   (You should use *variation of parameters*)
