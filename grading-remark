There have been some questions about the assignment of letters grades
(or more precisely: abouit the +/-'s next to letter grades) from your
score in the class.

We are using the grading scheme indicated here:

Some notes:

1. As you'll see at the link above, scores that round to a 92 earn an
   A-, while scores that round to a 93 or above earn an A. I.e. if your
   score is between 89.5 and 92.5, you earn an A-.

2. I (McNinch) made a mistake with the +-grade cutoffs, and we are
   fixing this mistake now.  The code I used incorrectly assigned a B to
   students with a score that rounded to an 87.  (I mistakenly thought
   that the range was 87.5--89.5, rather than 86.5--89.5). I apologize
   for this, and as I said, we are correcting the 4 or 5 grades affected
   by my error.

3. As mentioned in an earlier announcment, your score is determined by
   the formula

   0.3*high + 0.2*low + 0.3*recitation + 0.2*problem-sets

   where high is the higher of your two exam scores, low is the lower
   of your two exams scores, recitation is the average of your %
   scores on the recitation assignments, and problem-sets is the
   average of your % scores on the problem sets.

   you can find find all four of your scores on canvas and compute
   this class score.

   For example, suppose that you scored an 78 on the midterm, an 87 on
   the final, an 80 on the homework and an 84 on the recitation work.

   Then *high* = 87, *low* = 78, and your score is

   0.3*87 + 0.2*78 + 0.3*84 + 0.2*80 = 82.9

   Since 82.9 rounds to 83 -- i.e. since 82.9 >= 82.5 -- you would earn
   a B in the course with these scores.
